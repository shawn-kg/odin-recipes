            <li>1 cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sriracha sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rice:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups long-grain rice</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make chicken: Combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and coriander in a blender; blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag; pour in blended marinade and seal. Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Make yogurt sauce: Whisk yogurt, sriracha sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Cook skin-side down in the hot skillet until well browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Let chicken rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then chop into chunks.</li>
            <li>Make rice: Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add turmeric and cumin; cook and stir until fragrant. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook, stirring frequently, until toasted, about 4 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and cook until broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove Dutch oven from heat and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide rice and chicken among serving bowls. Drizzle yogurt sauce on top.</li>
        </ol>
